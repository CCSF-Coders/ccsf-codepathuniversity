# CodePath University application
1. Complete short application here:   __http://www.codepathuniversity.com__
1. Complete coding challenge by building a __basic Swift app by December 15th__
  - details of coding challenge will not be released to CCSF applicants until 100+ CCSF students have signed up
1. Students who work hard on the coding challenge will be invited to a __phone interview__
  - (I think) the interview will be screening for 2 things (and probably more):
    - is the applicant prepared for the time commitment (balancing with classes, work, family commitments, etc)? 
    - is the applicant community-minded (committed to helping other students, to paying-it-forward)?
1. The first 20 students who pass the phone interview will be admitted into the class

CodePath is selecting only 20 colleges, so CCSF is competing for this.
