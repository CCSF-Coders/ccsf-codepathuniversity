# CodePath University application
1. Complete short application here:   __http://www.codepathuniversity.com__
1. At least 100 students must sign up from CCSF, in order for CCSF to be considered for phase 2 of the application process
  - There is a temptation to get friends who aren't actually interested in the course to sign up, just to make the 100-person minimum, but don't do this.
  - Not everyone who says that they are interested will actually be able to make the time to participate in the course
  - The pressure of needing to get 100 "real" sign-ups keeps the recruiting going, and in the end result in enough committed students for the class to actually happen.
1. For phase 2 of the application process, the schools which meet the 100+ student sign-up minimum will receive a coding challenge to complete.
  - CodePath will share their learning materials & ask students to build a basic app
  - the basic app can be completed in a few hours, but the real challenge is use the materials provided to improve the basic app, and especially to focus on the design & user experience, which is what sets real apps apart in the app stores
  - Here is the coding challenge from Spring 2016: http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_ios/prework_university.md
1. In order for CCSF to be invited to participate, at least 20 app submissions must be completed by the due date

CodePath is selecting only a limited number of schools, so CCSF must have a strong showing to be invited.
