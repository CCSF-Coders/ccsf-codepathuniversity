# Submitting work to CodePath
- project README.md file
  - it's pretty easy to add a README file up on GitHub (there is a big green "Add a README" button on all projects without one)
  - once you click the "Add a README" button in your GitHub repo, then
  - paste this template into the "Edit new file" section:  http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_ios/readme_templates/prework_readme.md?raw=true
  - make changes to take out the generic  names & add your and your app's names
  - "Commit new file"
  - then Sync with the project as saved on your computer

- create animated GIF of your app:
  - download the latest version of [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for OSX
  - install on your Mac
  - open LICEcap from your Applications folder 
  - (you might select the "Keep in Dock" option)
  - adjust the "frame" of the LICEcap so it surrounds your Simulator demonstrating your app
  - press RECORD
  - save .GIF filename
  - wait until the word "PREROLL" disappears
  - then start interacting with your app
  - press STOP to end the recording

- add animated GIF to project README.md file:
  - save the new .GIF in the same folder as your README.md
  - edit the README.md (pretty easy to do up on GitHub by clicking on the README.md file & then clicking the pencil icon to edit)
  - add the following text to your README.md in between the text where you would like to see the animated GIF

    ``![Walkthrough](tips.gif)``

    - you don't have to use "Walkthrough" -- you could use any text.  And "tip.gif" is just the name of your animated GIF.
  - write a Commit message like 'add animated GIF to README.md' and click the green "Commit changes" button
  - then Sync with the project as saved on your computer

- checking off completed features in README.md checklist
  - you'll notice that, at the beginning of each item in the lists of features to implement, you'll see:

    `` * [ ] ``

    - this creates an unchecked checkbox.  
  - If later, you edited to this:

    `` * [x] ``

    - this will create a checked checkbox, indicating that you've implemented that feature.
