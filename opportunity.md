# Summary of CodePath University
CodePath University is a free 12-week mobile app development bootcamp for universities. CodePath piloted this program at Stanford in Fall 2015, and with 17 universities in Spring 2016. The pilot focused on developing iOS app development, but in the future Android app development will be offered too (likely Spring 2018).

- structure of CodePath University
  - in Fall: 
    - 4-week "Interview Prep" mini-course
  - in Spring: 
    - 12-week mobile development bootcamp (initially iOS, but in the future also Android)
      - two 2hr in-person classes per week (either M/W or T/Th)
      - several hours on Saturdays 
        - officially professional iOS developer/mentors were available 12n-2pm, but generally folks would keep working after)
      - plus ~15hrs of homework per week
    - During the first 8 weeks, assignment due every week
    - During the last 4 weeks, students form teams to build an app together
    - The program culminates with a Demo Day of all the team-built apps (cash prizes for the winners)
  - **__if any class is skipped or if assignment is not turned in on-time, the student is immediately dropped from  class__**
    - counterintuitively this requirment makes the course completion rate go up
  - Additionally, CodePath partner companies are looking to network with & offer internships to well-performing students
