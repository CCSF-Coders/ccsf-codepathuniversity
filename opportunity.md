- structure of CodePath University
  - CodePath University will be a 12-week program starting in January 2016
  - There will be two 2hr in-person classes per week, plus ~15hrs of homework per week.
  - During the first 8 weeks, there will be one app due every 2 weeks
      - **__if any home is not turned in on-time, the student will be immediately dropped from the class__**
          - counterintuitively this requirment makes the course completion rate go up
  - During the last 4 weeks, students form teams to build an app together
  - The program culminates with a Demo Day of all the team-built apps (cash prizes for the winners)
  - Additionally, CodePath partner companies are looking to network with & offer internships to well-performing students
