- video creation tools
  - QuickTime:  http://acomp.stanford.edu/tutorials/screen_recordings
- book classroom(s)
  - scheduling do's and don'ts:
    - immediately rule out holding the class at the same time as the equivalent CCSF class, very poor form - don't do it
- organize Demo Day
- build out this [how-to-organize-CodePathUniversity-bootcamp-at-CCSF](https://github.com/CCSF-Coders/ccsf-codepathuniversity) repo as we go along
  - how to create [screen-recodings with audio](http://acomp.stanford.edu/tutorials/screen_recordings) easily using the default QuickTime installed on Macs (note for future Android bootcamp: the default Quicktime on Windows doesn't capture audio as easily)
