# Logistics of CodePath University 
(assuming CCSF becomes 1 of the 20 pilot schools)

- set up class communication tools
  - [slack.com](https://slack.com/)
- book classroom(s)
- organize Demo Day
- build out this [how-to-organize-CodePathUniversity-bootcamp-at-CCSF](https://github.com/CCSF-Coders/ccsf-codepathuniversity) repo as we go along
  - how to create [screen-recodings with audio](http://acomp.stanford.edu/tutorials/screen_recordings) easily using the default QuickTime installed on Macs (note for future Android bootcamp: the default Quicktime on Windows doesn't capture audio as easily)

(more coming soon)
